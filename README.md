# Nepali Calculator
	Nepali calculator is a cross platform application, backed by flutter, built to implement the 
	concept of mathematical calculation in nepali numeric digits.
	Saying that it is a nepali calculator, it isn't a full-fledge application in itself. 
	Instead, it is a conceptual app and my approach to perfom calculation in nepali digits.
	
	It is developed as a basic project, during the learning period flutter for the practical implementation of my knowledge.
